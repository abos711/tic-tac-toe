1. Include a wireframe of what your game project will look like. This wireframe is for the [MVP (minimum viable product)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) of your application. Keep it simple!

1. How you will represent the game board in JS? Think about the layout of your gameboard, different data structures you can use, how you will interact with the board, and the logic that will be required to determine when the game is over.

**I plan to have 9 boxes of similar size for the tic tac toe board. In addition to wireframe attached, two more columns (one per side) to depict animal images belonging the animal classes (5 boxes per team)**

1. How you plan to approach this project?

**Work off the wireframe into outlining my atom and my the html on day 1. I hope to complete the login in buttons and have the color scheme and final pictures completed by day 2. day 3 and 4 will be dealing with the functionality of all of it. I'm terrified and pumped**

1. How you plan to keep your code modular?

**Break code out into several different directories and files. Create directory that holds my html and css/Assets/curl scripts**

1. What creative spin will you add to your project?

**Mammals vs Reptiles**
**Instead of X's and O's have different animal images belonging to similar animal classes that helps children group animals as well as play TTT.**

1. How will you use version control to backup / track your project?

**Git Commit often but not when something is half-done. Plan to test before committing.**
